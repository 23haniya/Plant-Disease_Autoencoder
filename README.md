# Plant-Disease_Autoencoder
This repository contains a deep learning project for classifying plant diseases using the PlantVillage dataset. It includes preprocessing, training an autoencoder, and using its encoder for classification. Model accuracy is evaluated, and misclassifications are analyzed by comparing original and reconstructed images.
